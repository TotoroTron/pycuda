This error may have been caused by the following argument(s):
- argument 0: cannot determine Numba type of <class 'matmul.Jit'>

This is not usually a problem with Numba itself but instead often caused by
the use of unsupported features or an issue in resolving types.

To see Python/NumPy features supported by the latest release of Numba visit:

and
